# Exercise 3 - Flow chart using Repeat, While and Do-While loops

### Aim:
To create a flowchart that repeats a specific task a certain number of times using repeat, while and do while in UiPath.

### Software required:
UiPath Studio-community edition

### Procedure:

### 1. Repeat Loop
- Step 1: Start with a Flowchart.
- Step 2: Add a Repeat Number of Times activity.
- Step 3: Set Repeat Number of Times to 5.
- Step 4: Inside the loop, add a Sequence with the following activities:
          Assign: counter = counter + 1
          Write Line: "repeat" + counter.ToString()

### 2. While Loop
- Step 1: Add a While activity in the Flowchart.
- Step 2: Set the Condition as counter < 5.
- Step 3: Inside the While activity, add a Sequence with the following activities:
          Assign: counter = counter + 1
          Write Line: "repeat" + counter.ToString()

### 3. Do While Loop
- Step 1: Add a Do While activity in the Flowchart.
- Step 2: Set the Condition as counter < 5.
- Step 3: Inside the Do While activity, add a Sequence with the following activities:
          Assign: counter = counter + 1
          Write Line: "repeat" + counter.ToString()
